max_tokens = Max tokens to use for each prompt IE: 300
prompt = what squares underneath the question prompt contain the object prompted?
         The squares returned should only consider the 9 images shown underneath the prompt and inside of the popup.
         return the answer in the format of Y for yes and n for no for each 9 squares.

         for example: [N, Y, N, N, N, Y, Y, N, Y]

         In this array, the first item should be the first square image from the photo,
         the second item in the array the second image and so on until all 9 images are added to the array.
         If you think the object might be in the image but are not 100% sure you should still mark it as Y
